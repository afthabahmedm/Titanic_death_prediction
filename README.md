# Titanic_death_prediction
The Titanic Survival Dataset is a popular dataset widely used in the fields of machine learning and data science. It contains detailed information about the passengers who were on board the RMS Titanic, the famous ship that tragically sank during its first voyage in 1912.

Overview:
This dataset is available in CSV format and offers a comprehensive view of the passengers' profiles, their travel details, and, importantly, whether they survived the disaster or not. Each row in the dataset represents a passenger and includes the following information:

- PassengerId: A unique ID for each passenger.
- Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- Pclass: The class of the passenger (1 for First, 2 for Second, 3 for Third).
- Name: The passenger's name.
- Sex: The passenger's gender (Male or Female).
- Age: The passenger's age.
- SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- Ticket: The passenger's ticket number.
- Fare: The price paid for the passenger's ticket.
- Cabin: The passenger's cabin number.
- Embarked: The port where the passenger boarded (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton).

## Potential Uses:
The Titanic Survival Dataset can be utilized for various data-driven projects:

1. Survival Prediction: Develop machine learning models to predict if a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. This can provide historical insights and help improve safety measures for future maritime travel.

2. Factors Affecting Survival: Analyze the dataset to identify the key factors that influenced a passenger's chances of survival. This information can guide policies and procedures to protect specific groups during disasters.

3. Demographic Exploration: Explore the demographics of Titanic passengers to gain a deeper understanding of the people on board and the societal and economic factors that played a role in the disaster.

4. Historical Analysis: Use the dataset to investigate the reasons behind the Titanic disaster and learn from the past to enhance safety precautions.
